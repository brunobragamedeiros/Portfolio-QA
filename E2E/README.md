# PortfolioQA - E2E

Now let's talk about E2E automation!

There are two folders here: _Cypress_ and _Selenium_.

**Cypress**
You will find some end to end tests on https://www.cypress.io/. In this project I used cypress commands to ensure code reuse. My idea with this project is to show you an example of how I structure the organization of tests and the way I automate things, always aiming at reusability and minimal code. 

**Selenium**
You will find some basic end to end tests around the sign up flow on Netflix. This is an old and deprecated project but you will find an example of Page Object pattern in this project.
