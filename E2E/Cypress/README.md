# QAfolio - E2E CYPRESS

I've been studying cypress for some time and I got to say: I really like it.
In this repo you will find tests performed on https://www.cypress.io/ using Cypress (not very original, I know... but it was an interesting experience).

I tested the pages_ /home_ and _/blog_ by creating UI tests (ex: checking button's title and links), E2E testing (ex: testing search feature).

To ensure code reuse, in some specific cases I created custom commands.
